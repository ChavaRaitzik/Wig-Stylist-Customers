Hi. I am a wig stylist, and as my business expands, I am looking for an organized system to keep track of my customers' details, preferences and upcoming appointments. 

I heard that you are a top company that will create a customized system according to my needs. I look forward to working with you.

Please note that this table is only to keep track of my clients and not my profits.
I would like to keep track of my clients' names, phone numbers, preferred contact method (either call, text, or whatsapp), and total number of appointments they've had to date.
If a client has an appointment scheduled, I would like to see the appointment's date and time. I would like to see how they want their wig styled for their appointment as well. 
I ask all new clients how they got to me so that I can keep track of my most effective marketing. Please include a marketing forum column in the table.
For business purposes, I would also like to know the date they were first entered into the systems.

Questions:
Q. Do you have multiple clients with the same first and last name?
A. No. If I already have a client with a particular name, I'll ask my new client to give me a nickname, middle initial, or something else to easily differentiate between them.
Q. Do you have a policy of how far in advance a client can book an appointment?
A. Yes, not more than 2 months in advance.
Q. Do you ever double book appointments?
A. No.
Q. What is the maximum number of appointments each client can have on schedule?
A. 3. I do not need to see past appointments. Please note that each appointment may need a different wig style. 
Q. Are there specific style choices that you offer your clients, or they can ask for any styles?
A. There are specific styles only. Either straight, wavy, curly, or crimpy.
Q. Would you like to keep track of the time that your clients were entered into the system as well?
A. No, the date is sufficient.

Reports: 
1) I would like to see the ways that people heard about me and how many people found out about me through each way.
    Please provide a list of my marketing forums, ordered from most to least popular.
2) I would like to be able to easily recognize my biggest clients. 
    Please provide a list of my clients and each one's total number of appointments. Order from most to least appointments.
3) I would like to easily see all my upcoming appointments and clients. 
    Please provide a list of upcoming appointments with the client's name included. Order from closest to farthest away.
4) I would like to be able to come into work each day, and see all my clients and their appointment times scheduled for that day. 
    Please provide a way for me to view my appointments each day. Order from earliest to latest in the day.
